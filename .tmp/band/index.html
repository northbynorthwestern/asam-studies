      <p>Purple knee-high socks, black socks, tights, leggings, fleece-lined leggings, shorts, tank top, long-sleeve Under Armour shirt, NUMB T-shirt, two pairs of gloves and a beanie. That&rsquo;s what the mellophone Calypso wore underneath her marching band uniform when she went to the game last Saturday.</p><p>&ldquo;IT&rsquo;S GAME DAY!&rdquo; screamed the Spirit Leaders as over-bundled band members trudged to buses along Sheridan at 10 a.m.</p><p>Already, it was time to get hyped for the game, a guaranteed &lsquo;Cats victory. The band started by holding practice out on the East field, marching the halftime show set by set, then song by song, then in full run-throughs. DJ Farris conducted in his usual fashion, standing on a podium in the center of the field as he called out sets and corrects individuals who are skewing a particular form on the field.</p><p>Of course, practice can&rsquo;t conclude without a run of pre-game, the set of songs and drill the band has been practicing since the first week of band camp. By the end of their time on the East Field, Calypso wondered if the number of layers may have been overkill.</p><p>Off the band went to Ryan Field to perform a sound check with Jim Cornelison, directed by the celebrated Dr. Thompson. Then it was time to play for the team.</p><p>Forming long lines of sections along the pavement leading to Ryan Field, the band passes the time spent waiting for the team by performing &ldquo;drum cheers.&rdquo; Each section has a specific routine for each drum patterns. Waving their instruments back and forth, swinging their hips, and jumping up and down were all fair game as fans started to arrive for the game.</p><p>&ldquo;The team&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; shouted a drum major, running through the mass of instrumentalists.</p><p>Instantly, the horns snapped up, playing the school song and &ldquo;Push On&rdquo; until every team member had paraded through.</p><p>Finally, there is time to eat lunch. Inside Welsh-Ryan, the students removed their shakos and jackets and collected some hot food. Everyone sat on the bleachers, eating food, chatting, and polishing instrument bells. Section leaders collected flip-folders, reminding the band to folder their warmers and leave them by their cases.</p><p>All too soon, the band applied their jackets and shakos, getting ready to march into Wildcat Alley for another performance of their halftime music. Pete Friedman was there, as usual, to announce the numbers with his characteristic bright description.</p><p>The fans cheered as the performance wrapped up, and the band must move on again. After huddling in sections for pre-game cheers, they lined up for pre-game, ready to growl their loudest and quick-entry step onto the field.</p><p>The show flew by, and the band headed off to the stands to play pep tunes and lead cheers as needed for the Northwestern student section.</p><p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; bellowed Spirit Leader Twinkie at Northwestern&rsquo;s first down.</p><p>&ldquo;Time to move the chains. WHOOSH!&rdquo; the band bellowed right back.</p><p>Five minutes before halftime, the band piled out to march some Queen ballads, finishing with a recycling symbol formation as Dr. Thompson directed Northwestern&rsquo;s alma mater. Then, they all head back to the stands for further pep and cheering.</p><p>The game does not run as smoothly as the band&rsquo;s halftime show.</p><p>There were no shakos turned backward at its conclusion (the normal sign of Northwestern victory. Still, the band formed a giant circle of NUMB members, as they do after every game, victory or loss.</p><p>&ldquo;Pitch, please,&rdquo; said Dr. Thompson, and the band sings the alma mater.</p><p>Watching fellow NUMB-ers shiver on their way back to Welsh-Ryan, Calypso felt pretty confident about her choice of layers. The loss is a little depressing, but in the end the band always wins.</p>
