        "article": "<p>At Northwestern, student activism is everywhere. We saw it last quarter with the NU Divest movement, and we see it every year when the school comes together to vote on its ASG members. But just 20 years ago, a piece of significant and extreme student activism occurred on campus that is rarely remembered or acknowledged.</p>\n<p>In 1995, a group of students went on a 24-day hunger strike. This act of student activism was an attempt to persuade the University to establish an Asian American Studies Program, a minor that would educate students on the history, culture and politics of Asians in the United States. The minor was finally created in 1999.</p>\n<p>Student interest in establishing an AAS program began in 1995 with student lobbying. Students from the Asian American Advisory Board (AAAB) as well as others with an interest in the cause worked together on a proposal for the program. According to professor Ji-Yeon Yuh, they had really done their research.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d gone out and composed a list of other universities with Asian American studies programs, a list of their courses, as well as syllabi and a list of the curriculums of other Asian American studies programs,&rdquo; Yuh said. &ldquo;This was a growing field and other universities already had it on their campuses.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Apparently Northwestern wasn&rsquo;t as responsive. But when the administration declined their request to establish a program, the students didn&rsquo;t give up.</p>\n<p>The first programs were founded in the late 1960s at two universities in California, by a coalition of students who were pushing for ethnic studies programs, according to Yuh. The students took over their school&rsquo;s offices and campus squares during the protests.</p>\n<p>In 1995, other universities also had protests for ethnic studies programs that same year, including Columbia University and Princeton University. But no other protests were hunger strikes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It takes a lot to go on a hunger strike &ndash; even if you only go on a strike for one day,&rdquo; Yuh said. &ldquo;It really testifies to the depth of commitment to those students and how strongly they felt. I think it also testifies to the students&rsquo; perception that the opposition from the Northwestern administration was so strong that they had to do a hunger strike to prove their point.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Professor Yuh was hired when the program was first established to help form it. She said the program&rsquo;s Dean, Eric Sundquist, was very supportive.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because students were voicing their desires for the program and their desire to see the program grow, the things the administration had promised in terms of program budget, program staff and additional program faculty were the things that all the students were keen on wishing for,&rdquo; Yuh said. &ldquo;So it just wasn&rsquo;t possible for the administration to backtrack and not do those things. It was good to have that constant (student) support.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Weinberg junior Kevin Luong is currently pursuing a minor in the Asian American Studies program. He said he enjoys the benefits of studying within a small department, and getting significant attention and support from the professors. Luong said that although he witnesses a lot of student activism around campus, nothing has been as extreme as a hunger strike.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s great to just continually revisit this history and see how the Asian American Studies department here at Northwestern was founded on activism,&rdquo; Luong said. &ldquo;I think we should continue practicing this activism not only academically, but also whenever the need comes.&rdquo;</p>",

        "article": "<p><em>Henry Bienen took office as Northwestern&rsquo;s president on January 1, 1995. A &nbsp;month later, he entered into the debate over the establishment of the Asian-American studies program, meeting with student activists and writing letters regarding the proposed program to the student-led Asian American Advisory Board. In an interview with NBN, Mr. Bienen discussed his memories of the protest and his prior experiences with student activism as a young professor at Princeton.</em></p>\n<p><strong>North By Northwestern:</strong> In the letters you wrote to student protesters, you repeatedly said you had &ldquo;an open mind&rdquo; about creating an Asian-American studies program. But, you also indicated the university would not respond to student demands and protests by immediately establishing a new program. Why did you respond in this way?</p>\n<p><strong>Henry Bienen:</strong> I wasn&rsquo;t about to announce it [the program] the way they [the students] wanted to do it, under pressure. Obviously, you have a new president come in and it sets a very bad precedent to go outside the procedures we have for doing this. Fundamentally, I believe the way you establish programs is to think them out, have funding in place for them, think about what faculty you have, what faculty you might hire and have the relevant deans approve.</p>\n<p><strong>NBN:</strong> For the Asian-American studies program specifically, what factors did you take into account when considering the students&rsquo; proposal?</p>\n<p><strong>HB:</strong> When you put a big label on these programs, like &ldquo;Asian-American Studies,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re really talking about immigration and geographic spread of lots of different kinds of people with different cultures and languages. That doesn&rsquo;t make it less interesting. In a way, it makes it more interesting. But it also meant there was a pretty wide net of things to consider. And that was a reason I thought deliberations and thinking it through was a good idea.</p>\n<p><strong>NBN:</strong> What was your reaction to the news that students were hunger striking to protest of the university&rsquo;s refusal to immediately establish a plan for a new department?</p>\n<p><strong>HB</strong>: As I recall, I said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make sure nobody hurts themselves, and that people are protected.&rdquo; So, we had people out there to have conversations and provide water, and food if anybody wanted it.</p>\n<p><strong>NBN:</strong> Were you surprised that some students responded so strongly, with the hunger strike?</p>\n<p><strong>HB:</strong> Not very. I&rsquo;ve been around universities a long time.</p>\n<p><strong>NBN:</strong> Explain further?</p>\n<p><strong>HB:</strong> I grew up as a faculty member in a period of intense turmoil over the Vietnam War in the sixties .... When I became a professor at Princeton, I was co-director of the Movement for New Congress with a graduate student of mine, Bill Murphy.</p>\n<p><strong>NBN:</strong> So, were you an activist? What did you do?</p>\n<p><strong>HB:</strong> I was always more interested in trying to be effective in an electoral process than I was in carrying signs or marching, I confess .... One of the interesting things about that movement is that it was a sort of in-system movement. It wasn&rsquo;t interested in burning down buildings. It was interested in mobilizing students.</p>\n<p><strong>NBN:</strong> So, you went through this &ldquo;activist phase,&rdquo; but seem reluctant to consider yourself an &ldquo;activist.&rdquo; Do you support student activism in general?</p>\n<p><strong>HB:</strong> I do support it. I want people to be what I would call &ldquo;constructive.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t like shouting people down, but I like to see people engaged in the world around them.</p>\n<p><strong>NBN:</strong> Do you consider Northwestern&rsquo;s campus &ldquo;activist&rdquo;?</p>\n<p><strong>HB:</strong> I think it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s waxed and waned.</p>\n<p><strong>NBN:</strong> What&rsquo;s the role of student activism, particularly on issues like the Vietnam War or the Asian-American studies program, on university campuses?</p>\n<p><strong>HB:</strong> Raising awareness is always a good thing. And universities do move slowly. Somewhere in between, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll do what you want tomorrow because you&rsquo;re protesting,&rdquo; and moving very slowly, students can have an effect on getting [universities] to think with greater urgency. That seems to be a good thing. It doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll always do what [students] want. But, you know, putting it on [the university&rsquo;s] agenda, thinking hard about it &ndash; it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>",
